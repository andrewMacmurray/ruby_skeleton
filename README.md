# Skeleton

A minimal setup for a ruby project with rspec

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have ruby and bundler installed
2. Install rspec with `bundle install`
3. Replace the example `lib/hello.rb` and `spec/hello_spec.rb` files with your own
4. Remove the `.git` folder and start a fresh one with `git init`
5. Delete this README! Add some documentation for your project

## Run the Spec

```
> bundle exec rspec
```

## Try out your code

If you'd like to mess around with code in `lib`, require it in the `bin/console` file and run it with

```
> bin/console
```

This will start an `irb` session with the code loaded
